# NetStrike (Scan Spoof Strike)

NetStrike is a GUI-based Python application for network scanning, ARP spoofing, and basic DoS attack simulation. Built using **Kivy** for the graphical interface, **Nmap**, **Scapy**, and **socket**, this tool is designed for educational and ethical hacking purposes only...

## Features

###  Scanning
- **Host Discovery** (Ping Sweep)
- **Scan All Devices** in the local network
- **Quick Scan** (Top 100 Ports)
- **Aggressive Scan** (OS, services, versions, etc.)
- **Full Scan** (All Ports)

###  ARP Spoofing
- Sends ARP spoof packets to a target and gateway.
- Can simulate man-in-the-middle conditions for testing purposes.

###  DoS (Denial of Service) Attack (Simulation)
- Basic TCP-based DoS attack on a given IP and port.
- Uses multithreading for high traffic simulation.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** All functionalities must be used in **authorized environments**. Misuse is illegal and unethical.
